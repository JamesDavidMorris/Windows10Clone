# Windows 10 Clone

*Windows 10 Clone* is an ongoing web application development project designed to emulate the user interface and functionality of the Windows 10 operating system. This project aims to provide users with a near 1-to-1 experience of the base Windows UI, including a functional persistent file structure, applications like Notepad, Calculator and Photo Viewer, and the ability to customise the environment with standard Windows UI features, such as desktop, wallpaper and theme changes, control panel access, system settings and more.

## Introduction

This project serves as a demonstration of full-stack development skills, showcasing the integration of a JavaScript front end with a C# backend to recreate the Windows 10 user experience within a web application.
